Developers: Amir Seidakhmetov and Joshua Wilbur

Driver code for the H-Bridge circuit is found in /Core/Src. The files main.c, HBridge.c and interrupt_callbacks.c contain custom code developed for this project. 
A more detailed README will be created in the future.

# Software TODO
* Impliment feedback code 
* Clean up unused code (ie photo-interruptor stuff)
* Try to use DMA again, it was troublesome the first time around
* Research programming the STM32L476RG without a dev board.
* Wireless controller (if time avails).
